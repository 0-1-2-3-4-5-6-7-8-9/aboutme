    <strong>This is an act of faith.</strong> Faith being the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen according to Hebrews 11:1.<br />
    It is written in Hebrews 11:6 that without faith it is impossible to please God. James further cements this crucial detail by warning us that we will <br />
    recieve nothing from God without faith (see James 1:7). Romans 14:23 states that what is not of faith is sin. James 2:26 informs us that faith <br />
    without works is dead. Implying one can have all the faith in the world but if they dont use their faith then it is rendered meaningless. :. I choose <br>
    to use my faith because firstly it compels God to delight in me and bless me and secondly why would i not want that? It's this simple <br>
    when God rests his hand of favour upon you: there is no person, or power, or circumstance that can stop you from succeeding. <br>

  <h3>What we <strong>must</strong>  know</h3>

  <ol type="i">
    <li>(John 14:13) <ul>
        Jesus said, “Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.”<br>
      </ul>
    </li> <br>

    <li>(John 14: 14) <ul>
        You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it. <br>
      </ul>
    </li> <br>

    <li>(John 15:7) <ul>
        If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. <br>
      </ul>
    </li> <br>


    <li>(John 16:23b) <ul>
        Very truly I tell you, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. <br>
      </ul>
    </li> <br>


    <li>(John 16:24) <ul>
        Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete. <br>
      </ul>
    </li> <br>


    <li>(Mark 11:23) <ul>
        “Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them. <br>
      </ul>
    </li> <br>


    <li>(Mark 11:24) <ul>
        Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. <br>
      </ul>
    </li> <br>
  </ol>

   From the above it is evident that Jesus instructs us to ask and trust in him.
  <br> And since this occurs more than three times at three different points in the bible we can safely confirm this as doctrine.
